In this post I'm going to illustrate how to implement a finite element simulation of an [alternator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_generator) in motion coupled to a linear electrical circuit.

<!-- more -->

The simulation computes the magnetic vector potential within a (2D) radial cross section of the machine I'm about to describe.

Here's the result:

Code is [here](https://github.com/ssrb/alternator-fem-webapp)

## Description of the machine

The machine we're going to study is an unusual induction generator of the [squirel-cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel-cage_rotor) type.

This is `\(1/12^{th}\)` of the machine:
![machine]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets }}/machine.png)

The rotor has 12 massive coper rods shorted by rings at both ends: the so called squirel cage.
Rods are enclosed in a cyclinder made of iron laminations.

The stator, made of iron laminations too, has 12 winding slots. The winding pattern is as follow: 

![winding1]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets }}/winding-1.png)

Notice that the field coil goes up/up, down/down, up/up ...
This will be very important later on when computing the [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density) in the coils.

![winding2]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets }}/winding-2.png)

Again, notice that the armature coil goes up/down when the field coil goes up/up, and then down/up, up/down ...


The diameter of the machine is 80mm, its depth/thickness is 50mm.

## Modelization

### Periodicity

Because of the problem periodicity, we can reduce the ammount of computation by modeling only a slice of the machine.

To find the size of the smallest possible slice we compute the [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) (`\(gcd\)`) of the number of rods and slots and only simulate a `\(360 / gcd\)` degrees machine slice.

Next, in order to decide if we need to use [periodic or anti-periodic boundary conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_boundary_conditions) to join our alternator slices, we simply observe that if we apply [Kirchof current's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws) to the rotor squirel cage topology, the [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) flowing through one rod will flow in the opposite direction in the previous and next rods so that we use periodic (respectively anti-periodic) boundary condition if the slice contains an even (respectively odd) number of rod.

It comes that for this particular endeavour we can simulate `\(1/12^{th}\)` of the machine (30 degrees), so a single rod and a single slot, and must use _anti-periodic_ boundary condition.

Whem implementing the finite element method using first order Lagrange element to solve non periodic problem we have a one to one mapping between mesh vertices and [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry))(`\(dof\)`) so that we can identify vertices with `\(dof\)`.

For example a single quadrangular first order Lagrange element has 4 vertices and leads to a 4 `\(dof\)` [stiffness matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness_matrix):

![element]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets }}/element-1.png)

However if we consider an (anti-)periodic along one axis element, it leads to a 2 `\(dof\)` stiffness matrix:

![periodic element]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets }}/element-2.png)

We can also illustrate further what's going on by writing the equations:

$$\begin{aligned} 
    & 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    a_{0,0} & a_{0,1} & a_{0,2} & a_{0,3}\\\
    a_{1,0} & a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & a_{1,3}\\\
    a_{2,0} & a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & a_{2,3}\\\
    a_{3,0} & a_{3,1} & a_{3,2} & a_{3,3}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    x_0\\\
    x_1\\\
    x_2\\\
  	x_3
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    b_0 \\\
    b_1 \\\ 
    b_2 \\\
    b_3
    \end{pmatrix}\\\
	\Leftrightarrow & 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    a_{0,0} & a_{0,1} & a_{0,2} & a_{0,3}\\\

    =
    \begin{pmatrix}

    b_1 \\\ 
    b_2 \\\
    b_3
    \end{pmatrix}, x_1 = \pm x_0, x_3 = \pm x_2 \text{, as per stiffness matrix symmetry and element periodicity}\\\
	\Leftrightarrow &

    a_{0,1} \pm a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} \pm a_{1,3}\\\
    a_{0,2} \pm a_{1,2} & a_{2,2} \pm a_{2,3}\\\
    a_{0,3} \pm a_{1,3} & a_{2,3} \pm a_{3,3}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}

    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    b_0 \\\
    b_1 \\\ 
    b_2 \\\
    b_3
    \end{pmatrix}, x_1 = \pm x_0, x_3 = \pm x_2\\\
    \Leftrightarrow & 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    a_{0,0} \pm 2 a_{0,1} + a_{1,1} & a_{0,2} \pm a_{0,3} \pm a_{1,2} + a_{1,3}\\\
    a_{0,2} \pm a_{0,3} \pm a_{1,2} + a_{1,3} & a_{2,2} \pm 2 a_{2,3} + a_{3,3}

    =

    b_0 \pm b_1\\\
    b_2 \pm b_3
    \end{pmatrix}, x_1 = \pm x_0, x_3 = \pm x_2
    \end{aligned}$$

Notice that we also end up with a symmetric linear system.

So that the key to implement (anti-)peridic boundary conditions is to compute the [non injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function) mapping from mesh vertices to `\(dof\)` as well as introduce a sign/polarity vector in order to remember the sign of each nodal value relative to its `\(dof\)`
(or in short: to deal with all these `\(\pm\)` in the equations).

* This is how I compute the mapping:

### Motion

In order to simulate the entire machine, we need to match rotor and stator `\(dof\)` along their common interface.
One way to get a match is to first discretize the interface and then use these interface vertices to compute the [Delaunay triangulations](https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) of both the stator and rotor domains.

![mesh]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets }}/alter012.000.png)

How about motion ? Idealy we would like to solve for *any* rotor/stator angle.
That's doable but a bit too ambitious and we're instead going to only consider rotations multiple of a fixed "rotation step".
Furthermore we choose a "rotation step" equal to a unit fraction of the domain slice angle, for example `\(1/32\)` of 30 degrees, so that, by uniformly dividing the interface into 32 segments we can match rotor and stator `\(dof\)` regardless of the "discrete" rotation angle.

The advantage of this method is that we compute mesh for both domains once and for all, regardless of the rotation angle.

A drawback of this method is that given the angular speed of the rotor we need to choose the time step of the simulation accordingly.
In our example, for a rotor speed of 3000rpm, the time step will be `\(60 / (12 * 32 * 3000)\)` seconds.

As it rotates, the rotor slice will face both a stator and an "anti-stator" slice. 
But we won't explicitely model the anti-stator slice since its nodal values are the opposite of those of the stator slice.
Instead we will model a rotor slice which wraps around and use the sign/polarity vector introduced earlier in order to decide if a rotor nodal value is coupled to a stator or "anti-stator" `\(dof\)`.

One last thing we need to discuss is how to generate the mapping between rotor/stator "local" `\(dof\)` to the machine "global" `\(dof\)`:

1. We first map interior "local" `\(dof\)` for both domains;
2. We then match interface rotor/stator local `\(dof\)` and assign a single "global" `\(dof\)` to each pair.

Here is a sketch:
![motion]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets }}/element-3.png)

Here is how I compute the mapping:

### Maxwell's equations

In this section, I will describe as concisely as I can the derivation of the [PDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) we're about to solve.

DISCLAIMER: I'M BY NO MEANS A MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS EXPERT.

Within the machine, the physical quantities we're intested in, such as magnetic vector potential and current density, are governed by [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations).

* The main equation we're interested in is the differential form of [Amp√®re's circuital law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law#Differential_form) which
relates the magnetic vector potential `\(A\)` to the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field) `\(E\)`:

$$\nabla \times \left(\mu \nabla \times A \right) = \sigma E \$$

`\(\mu\)` is the [relative magnetic permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)) and `\(\sigma\)` the [electrical conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity). In this toy simulation, these quantities are assumed constant for a particular medium (coper, iron, air).

* The next equation we use is the [Maxwell‚ÄìFaraday induction law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction#Maxwell.E2.80.93Faraday_equation).
It relates the electric field `\(E\)` to the magnetic vector potential `\(A\)` and the [electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential) `\(V\)` :

$$E = -\nabla V - \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}$$

Putting these two together we got:

$$\nabla \times \left(\mu \nabla \times A \right) + \sigma \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = - \sigma \nabla V$$

For this 2D problem `\(A\)` and `\(\nabla V\)` are reduced to their z components. That is `\(A \equiv \left(0,0,A\right)\)` and `\(\nabla V \equiv \left(0,0,\partial V / \partial z\right) \)`.

Now we're going to make a gross simplification and say that `\(\partial V / \partial z \neq 0\)` only within the coils. 
Furthermore, within a coil, we're going to estimate this quantity as the difference of electric potential at both ends of a single conductor 
divided by its length: 

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial z} = \frac{V_{z_b} - V_{z_a}}{L}$$

Since the machine is 50mm thick, we set `\(L = 0.05\)`.

Then, using [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law), we say that:

$$V_{z_a} - V_{z_b} = iR$$

with `\(i\)` the current going through the coil and `\(R\)` the resistance of that 50mm long coper conductor.
Remember that we care about the sign of `\(i\)` which depends on the winding pattern.

We can estimate `\(R\)` using [Pouillet's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity):

$$R = \frac{L}{\sigma \mathscr{A}}$$

with `\(\mathscr{A}\)` the cross-sectional area of the conductor.

Ultimately within a single conductor we got:

$$- \sigma \nabla V \equiv \sigma \frac{V_{z_a} - V_{z_b}}{L} = \sigma \frac{iR}{L} = \sigma \frac{i}{L} \cdot \frac{L}{\sigma \mathscr{A}} = \frac{i}{\mathscr{A}}$$

In the code we estimate the cross-sectional area of a single conductor dividing the cross-sectional area of the entire coil by the number of conductors within the coil.

Putting everything back together we want to solve:

$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned} 
\nabla \times \left(\mu \nabla \times A \right) + \sigma \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}}\psi_k i_k\\\
\psi_k(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\mathscr{A}_k} \text{ within coil } k\\\
0 \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}\label{eq:eq_potential_current}\end{equation}$$

for `\(A \equiv \left(0,0,A\right)\)` and `\(i_k, k = 1 \dots n_{coil}\)`.

### Coupling between magnetic & electrical equations

At this stage we got two unknowns:

* the magnetic vector potential `\(A\)`;
* the currents flowing through the coils `\(i_k, k = 1 \dots n_{coil}\)`

We are going to get rid of the current.

#### Admittance matrix

In order to do so we model the _linear_ electrical circuit connected to the machine using a [lumped element model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumped_element_model):
this will give us another relationship between `\(A\)` and `\(i_k, k = 1 \dots n_{coil}\)`.

The lumped element model of an N port linear electrical circuit can be treated as a single black box whose behavior is concisely described by its [admittance parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance_parameters):

$$\begin{pmatrix}i_1\\\ \vdots \\\ i_N \end{pmatrix} = Y \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\\ \vdots \\\ v_N \end{pmatrix}$$

where `\(v_k, k = 1, \ldots, N\)` is the voltage at each port of the circuit.

`\(Y\)` is called the [nodal admittance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_admittance_matrix). 

`\(Y\)` is symmetrical and it is extremely important as if it wasn't we would not end up with a [symmetrical bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_bilinear_form) later on when trying to solve the PDE.

We can label the ports of the electrical circuit so that:

$$\begin{pmatrix}i_1\\\ \vdots \\\ i_{n_{coil}}\\\ i_{n_{coil} + 1}\\\ \vdots \\\ i_N \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} Y_{coils, coils} && Y_{coils, others} \\\  Y_{others, coils}  && Y_{others, others} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\\ \vdots \\\ v_{n_{coil}} \\\ v_{n_{coil} + 1} \\\ \vdots \\\ v_N \end{pmatrix}$$

and since we only care about `\(i_k, k = 1, \ldots, n_{coil}\)` we write:

$$\begin{cases}
\begin{pmatrix}i_1\\\ \vdots \\\ i_{n_{coil}}\end{pmatrix} = I_0 + Y_{coils, coils} \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\\ \vdots \\\ v_{n_{coil}}\end{pmatrix}\\\
I_0 = Y_{coils, others} \begin{pmatrix}v_{n_{coil} + 1} \\\ \vdots \\\ v_N\end{pmatrix}
\end{cases}$$

#### Electromotive force

When the machine is connected to the circuit, the voltage at each port will be equal to the [electromotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force) `\(\mathcal{E}_k\)` generated in the matching coil:

$$v_k = \mathcal{E}_k, k = 1, \ldots, n_{coil}$$

As per [Lenz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz%27s_law):

$$\mathcal{E_k}=-\frac{\partial \Phi_k}{\partial t}$$

where `\(\Phi_k\)` is the [magnetic flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux).

Furthermore

$$ \Phi_k = L \int_{\Omega} \psi_k A dx$$

Finally we can rewrite the dextral side of `\(\eqref{eq:eq_potential_current}\)`:

$$\begin{aligned} 
\sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}}\psi_k i_k & = \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}}\psi_k \left( I_{0,k} + \sum_{l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k.l} v_l\right) \\\
& = \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}}\psi_k \left( I_{0,k} - \sum_{l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k.l} \frac{\partial \Phi_l}{\partial t} \right) \\\
& = \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}}\psi_k \left( I_{0,k} - L \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \sum_{l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A dx \right)
\end{aligned}$$

and group the vector potential terms on the sinistral side:

$$\begin{equation}
\nabla \times \left(\mu \nabla \times A \right) + \sigma \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + L \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \psi_k \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A dx = \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}}\psi_k I_{0,k}
\label{eq:eq_potential}\end{equation}$$

We want to solve for the magnetic vector potential.

### Discretization

At this stage it's only calculus.

#### Time

To solve `\(\eqref{eq:eq_potential}\)` numericaly we first integrate over time using the [backward Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_Euler_method).
It leads to

$$\begin{equation}
\nabla \times \left(\mu \nabla \times A_{t+\Delta t} \right) + \frac{\sigma}{\Delta t} A_{t+\Delta t} + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \psi_k \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t+\Delta t} dx = \frac{\sigma}{\Delta t}A_{t} + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \psi_k \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t} dx + \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}}\psi_k I_{0,k}\label{eq:eq_potential_time}
\end{equation}$$

We want to solve for `\(A_{t+\Delta t}\)`. 

BEWARE: remember that `\(\Delta t\)` depends on the way we spatialy discretized the rotor/stator interface as well as the rotor speed.

#### Space

We next integrate over space using the [finite element method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method). Weak formulation of `\(\eqref{eq:eq_potential_time}\)` one baby step at a time (as usual, I skip all the functional analysis details as I'm an engineer, not a mathematician :-)):

$$\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
& \nabla \times \left(\mu \nabla \times A_{t+\Delta t} \right) + \frac{\sigma}{\Delta t} A_{t+\Delta t} + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \psi_k \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t+\Delta t} dx = \frac{\sigma}{\Delta t}A_{t} + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \psi_k \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t} dx + \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}}\psi_k I_{0,k}\\\
\Leftrightarrow & v \cdot \nabla \times \left(\mu \nabla \times A_{t+\Delta t} \right) + \frac{\sigma}{\Delta t} v A_{t+\Delta t} + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} v Y_{k,l} \psi_k \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t+\Delta t} dx = \frac{\sigma}{\Delta t} v A_{t} + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} v Y_{k,l} \psi_k \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t} dx + \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}} v \psi_k I_{0,k}, \forall v\\\
\Leftrightarrow & \int_{\Omega}  v \cdot \nabla \times \left(\mu \nabla \times A_{t+\Delta t} \right) dx + \int_{\Omega}  \frac{\sigma}{\Delta t} v A_{t+\Delta t} dx + \int_{\Omega} \left( \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} v Y_{k,l} \psi_k \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t+\Delta t} dx \right) dx = \int_{\Omega} \frac{\sigma}{\Delta t} v A_{t} dx + \int_{\Omega} \left( \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} v Y_{k,l} \psi_k \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t} dx \right) dx + \int_{\Omega} \left( \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}} v \psi_k I_{0,k} \right) dx, \forall v\\\
\Leftrightarrow & \int_{\Omega}  \mu  \left( \nabla \times v \right) \left( \nabla \times A_{t+\Delta t} \right) dx + \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_{\Omega} \sigma v A_{t+\Delta t} dx + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \left( \int_{\Omega}  \psi_k v dx \right) \left( \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t+\Delta t} dx \right) = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_{\Omega} \sigma v A_{t} dx + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \left( \int_{\Omega} \psi_k v dx \right) \left( \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t} dx \right) + \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}} \int_{\Omega} v \psi_k I_{0,k} dx, \forall v\\\
\Leftrightarrow & \int_{\Omega}  \mu  \left( \nabla \cdot v \right) \left( \nabla \cdot A_{t+\Delta t} \right) dx + \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_{\Omega} \sigma v A_{t+\Delta t} dx + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \left( \int_{\Omega}  \psi_k v dx \right) \left( \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t+\Delta t} dx \right) = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_{\Omega} \sigma v A_{t} dx + \frac{L}{\Delta t} \sum_{k,l = 1}^{n_{coil}} Y_{k,l} \left( \int_{\Omega} \psi_k v dx \right) \left( \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t} dx \right) + \sum_{k = 1}^{n_{coil}} \int_{\Omega} v \psi_k I_{0,k} dx, \forall v
\end{aligned}\label{eq:eq_potential_space_time}
\end{equation}$$

BEWARE: coils `\(dof\)` are coupled together even though the corresponding vertices don't belong to a same triangle. This coupling is due to the linear electrical circuit.
This corresponds to the `\(\left( \int_{\Omega}  \psi_k v dx \right) \left( \int_{\Omega} \psi_l A_{t+\Delta t} dx \right)\)` terms in the equation.

## Conclusion

Work in progress ;-)
